## How To Read This Report

- Same-model baseline and `+ SteerMoE` columns use the same MoE model when both are present.
- Any reference-model column is unsteered question-only context; it is not the steering control.
- `Question-only test prompt` is the exact prompt sent to each generation condition.
- The concept prefix is intentionally omitted during this steering test.
- `Prefix-conditioned diagnostic prompt` is shown for context only.
- Baseline/reference columns = question-only prompt, no steering.
- `+ SteerMoE` columns = question-only prompt plus router bias from the saved SteerMoE plan.
